# Clear!

This bot's purpose is to nuke DM's and messages you don't want lingering. ðŸš®

## Usage

In this bot, the default prefix is `!`! Please read the documentations in `bot.py` to see how you can change it.

The following commands will contain `{prefix}`, think of that as a replacer, where instead of writing `{prefix}clear`, you'd run `!clear` or whatever your prefix might be.

`{prefix}clear NUMBER_OF_MESSAGES`

## Setup
Download the files for the bot and make sure Python 3.6+ is installed.
After you have done those steps, simply install the following dependencies:

* discord.py

You can do this by typing `pip install discord.py` into cmd as long as Python is in path.

After this, open the bot file in an IDE or text editor and input your token.
